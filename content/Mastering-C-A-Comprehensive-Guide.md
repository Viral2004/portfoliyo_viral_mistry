C is one of the most important programming languages. It's the foundation of many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python.

## Introduction

C is a procedural programming language. It has been used to build operating systems, embedded systems, and more. Its efficiency and simplicity make it a popular choice.

## Getting Started with C

### Writing Your First C Program

Create a file named `hello.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, C!
");
  return 0;
}
```

Compile and run it using:

```bash
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```

## C Variables and Data Types

C provides several basic data types:

- **int**: Integer numbers
- **float**: Floating-point numbers
- **char**: Single character
- **double**: Double-precision floating-point numbers

```c
int age = 25;
float height = 5.9;
char grade = 'A';
```

---

## Functions in C

Functions help you organize code into reusable blocks.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void greet() {
  printf("Hello from a function!
");
}

int main() {
  greet();
  return 0;
}
```

---

## Pointers

Pointers store the memory address of another variable.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int age = 25;
  int *ptr = &age;

  printf("Age: %d
", *ptr);  // Dereferencing the pointer
  return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

C is a powerful and efficient language for system-level programming. It is foundational and can be used in many fields.

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ‰
