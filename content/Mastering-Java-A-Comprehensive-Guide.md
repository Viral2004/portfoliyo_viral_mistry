## Getting Started with Java

### Setting Up Java

To start programming in Java, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### Writing Your First Java Program

Create a file named `HelloWorld.java`:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
  }
}
```

Run it in the terminal using the following commands:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

## Java Variables and Data Types

Java supports various data types:

- **int**: Integer numbers
- **double**: Floating-point numbers
- **boolean**: True/False values
- **String**: A sequence of characters

```java
int age = 25;
boolean isActive = true;
String name = "Alice";
```

## Object-Oriented Programming

Java is object-oriented, meaning everything revolves around classes and objects.

```java
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  void introduce() {
    System.out.println("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person person = new Person("Alice", 25);
    person.introduce();
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Java is a powerful and versatile language used in many fields, from web development to Android apps. Mastering Java will help you build scalable and high-performance applications.

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ‰
