## Getting Started with CSS

### Basic Syntax

CSS consists of selectors and declarations. A declaration contains a property and a value.

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

### Adding CSS to HTML

You can add CSS to HTML in three ways:

1. **Inline CSS**: `<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello</h1>`
2. **Internal CSS**: `<style>h1 { color: blue; }</style>`
3. **External CSS**: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`

## Box Model

The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements. It consists of:

- **Content**: The actual content of the box.
- **Padding**: Clears area around the content.
- **Border**: Border surrounding the padding (optional).
- **Margin**: Clears area outside the border.

## Flexbox and Grid

- **Flexbox** is used for laying out items in a one-dimensional row or column.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

- **Grid** allows for two-dimensional layouts.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```
